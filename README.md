# Creative Programming With Arduino

Welcome to the Creative Programming with Arduino Tutorial!

This guide is to be used as part of the Creative Programming with Arduino workshop. The workshop is designed to give people with little to no electronics or programming experience a running start! Not everything can be covered but we will use basic commands and devices to tackle some advanced concepts in programming, and hopefully it will be fun!

Activities will include using the Arduino to control programmable LEDs, make music with buzzers and get input from basic control hardware and a digital sensor.

All of the information provided here is free to use as you wish. All code is provided under the open source GPLv3 License, external libraries are all open source and provided under license as described in the provided examples.

I have avoided putting print commands in the code examples for the most part to avoid the code being convoluted and difficult to read. There are of course plenty of comments within each example.

### What you need for the workshop:

(Links are provided as examples)

* A computer to work on
* An [Arduino Uno](https://www.rapidonline.com/arduino-uno-a000066-board-r3-73-4440) (most other Arduino models/clones will also work but in order to make it happen you might need to do some more work and research beyond the scope of this wiki)
* A printer style USB Cable
* A small [breadboard](https://www.rapidonline.com/rapid-tp-039-solderless-breadboard-transparent-400-points-34-0671)
* A pack of [breadboard jumper wires](https://www.rapidonline.com/rapid-jw-003-breadboard-jumper-wires-bundle-of-75-34-0673)
* A couple of connected [WS2812 / Neopixel](https://www.rapidonline.com/adafruit-2867-neopixel-addressable-led-stick-8-x-5050-rgbw-warm-white-3000k-73-5278) LEDs, 8 is a good number.

*The rest is optional...*

* A piezo buzzer
* A breadboard friendly [button](https://www.rapidonline.com/zip-switch-mini-push-button-t602-1-pole-on-off-24v-dc-50ma-5mm-50-1054)
* A breadboard friendly [10k potentiometer](https://www.rapidonline.com/taiwan-alpha-rv16af-10k-lin-16mm-metal-case-pcb-potentiometer-65-0715)
* A [DHT11](https://www.amazon.co.uk/HALJIA-Digital-Temperature-Humidity-Arduino/dp/B06Y99X3NS/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1533302660&sr=8-3&keywords=DHT11) Sensor
